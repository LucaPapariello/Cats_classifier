#  Deep neural network for cats classification

## General

This repository contains code written in Python for the classification of cats images.

The neural network (NN) is constructed from scratch, without using deep learning frameworks.
As such, it is meant to get a better understanding of how neural networks work and **not**
to be high-performance code!

## Details

The Python script `NN_prop_utils.py` contains all the functions needed for the initialization,
forward and backward propagation, and the parameters update.

In the Jupyter notebook `NN_cats_classifier.ipynb` the NN model is built and trained.
